<h1> Hulk </h1>

I like having soft legs, freshly shaved limbs, cocoa butter shellacked into my pores
<br>

I like having soft hair, pulling 2 in 1 shampoo conditioner through the forest that lives on my scalp, wringing jojoba oil through my bouncy 4c curls
<br>

I like having soft lips, gently exfoliated with vitamin E sugar scrub until only a coconut oil sheen remains.
<br>

Mwen vle boush mwen belle toukou mwen ge moun k'ap ton pou'm bo yo, mem si nou poko fe connaissance. Like I’m in a rom com or something.
<br>

I like being soft almost as much as I like being beautiful, and I like being beautiful.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Like when someone says mwen semble mama’m, and my mother hears it,
<br>

Like l’em sal’ye au moun who remembers more than just my name
<br>

That’s when I feel beautiful.
<br>

I like being beautiful almost as much as I like being heard.
<br>

Like when le au moun munde s’ak passe and I tell them, and they believe me.
<br>

I like when I know the answer to a question,
<br>

When I try to find the answer to a question
<br>

I like questions, every fact a brick in the pathway to my Heaven.
<br>

As I walk, I pray for sweet dreams but find that lang mwen lou, my soft lips are weighted by cement now.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Heavy tongue isolate me still
<br>

Bear the weight of my inadequacy
<br>

I can do no language justice
<br>

Watch how words alone can stick
<br>

Toukou gratin ki brule umba un diri bon,
<br>

Is there no shame in fumbling over your mother tongue?
<br>

Grace a misericord, ou pa wont?

<br>
<br>
<br>

If one day I were to speak before my Creator, hair unruly,
<br>

E L’ta munde’m what I think of a Second Chance,
<br>

Au lot cours a cors,
<br>

I might ask Him to make me softer this time
<br>

Pou’L  bay mwen au coeur de l’ors, a heart called into existence by all the lore I’ve heard told about loving unconditionally

<br>
<br>
<br>

Please God,
<br>

This softness you have given me makes even my broken speech seem whole
<br>

So grant me this: Fe cors mwen sua
<br>

Make me whole: coeur mwen sua,
<br>

Make this holy: tete mwen sua,
<br>

S’il vous plait, bay mwen bou rev selma’n chak soir.
<br>

And please do not relegate my sweet dreams to the nighttime.
<br>

Make everything soft like blankets, soft like lullabies, soft like freshly shaved legs against my fingertips.
