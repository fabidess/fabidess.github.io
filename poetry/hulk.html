<h1> Hulk </h1>

I like having soft legs, freshly shaved limbs, cocoa butter shellacked into my pores

I like having soft hair, pulling 2 in 1 shampoo conditioner through the forest that lives on my scalp, wringing jojoba oil through my bouncy 4c curls

I like having soft lips, gently exfoliated with vitamin E sugar scrub until only a coconut oil sheen remains. Because somewhere out there, someone is waiting for me to kiss them, mem si nou poko fe connaissance. Like I’m in a rom com or something.

I like being soft almost as much as I like being beautiful, and I like being beautiful.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Like when someone says mwen semble mama’m, and my mother hears it,

Like l’em sal’ye au moun who remembers more than just my name

That’s when I feel beautiful.

I like being beautiful almost as much as I like being heard.

Like when le au moun munde s’ak passe and I tell them, and they believe me.

I like when I know the answer to a question,

When I try to find the answer to a question

I like questions, every fact a brick in the pathway to my Heaven.

As I walk, I pray for sweet dreams but find that lang mwen lou, my soft lips are weighted by cement now.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Heavy tongue isolate me still

Bear the weight of my inadequacy

I can do no language justice

Watch how words alone can stick

Toukou gratin ki brule umba un diri bon,

Is there no shame in fumbling over your mother tongue?

Grace a misericord, ou pa wont?

<br>
<br>
<br>

If one day I were to speak before my Creator, hair unruly,

E L’ta munde’m what I think of a Second Chance,

Au lot cours a cors,

I might ask Him to make me softer this time

Pou’L  bay mwen au coeur de l’ors, a heart called into existence by all the lore I’ve heard told about loving unconditionally

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Please God,

This softness you have given me makes even my broken speech seem whole

So grant me this: Fe cors mwen sua

Make me whole: coeur mwen sua,

Make this holy: tete mwen sua,

S’il vous plait, bay mwen bou rev selma’n chak soir.

And please do not relegate my sweet dreams to the nighttime.

Make everything soft like blankets, soft like lullabies, soft like freshly shaved legs against my fingertips.
